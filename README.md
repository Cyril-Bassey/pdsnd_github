### Project Title
*My Personal Basic Data Exploration with pandas on Bikeshare Data.*

### Description
This is a Python project that uses pandas to explore bikeshare data.


### Project Overview

The project has its focus on simple statistics methods and pandas library usage to perform an analysis on the bikeshare data of  Chicago, Washington, and New York City.

### How to run the program

This program can be run by input 'python bikeshare.py' on your terminal. I used Git bash command prompt on a Windows 11 machine.


### Details of the program

**The code in the program processes a user input for either of the three cities, month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. January; also includes an 'all' option), and day.**

**It goes on to ask the user about their choice to view the raw data of 5 rows or not. **
*Following the input received, the program prints the following details:**

- The youngest user (if available)
- Most popular month
- Most popular hour
- Total trip duration
- Most popular start station
- Types of users by number
- Types of users by gender (if available)
- The oldest user (if available)
- Most popular end station
- Most popular combination of start and end stations
- Average trip duration
- Most popular day.
- The most common birth year amongst users (if available)
After which the user is asked  the choice of restarting the whole program or not.

### Files used
- new_york_city.csv - Is a Dataset that contains all bikeshare information for the city of New York given by Udacity
- chicago.csv -  This is a dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Chicago 
- washington.csv - Is a Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Washington Note: This does not include the 'Gender' or 'Birth Year' data.

### Credits
- Udacity - The best of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program and their instructors were extremely helpful to this extent I have reached
- pandas docs - pandas documentation was immensely helpful in understanding the implemention of pandas methods used in this project.

### Built with

- Python 3.6.9- The language used to develop this.
- Pandas - One of the libraries used for this.
- Numpy - One of the libraries used for this.
- Time - One of the libraries used for this.
